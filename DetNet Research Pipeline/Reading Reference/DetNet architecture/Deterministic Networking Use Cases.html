</pre><pre class="para">                   Deterministic Networking Use Cases

</pre><pre class="para">Abstract

</pre><pre class="para">   This document presents use cases for diverse industries that have in
   common a need for "deterministic flows".  "Deterministic" in this
   context means that such flows provide guaranteed bandwidth, bounded
   latency, and other properties germane to the transport of time-
   sensitive data.  These use cases differ notably in their network
   topologies and specific desired behavior, providing as a group broad
   industry context for Deterministic Networking (DetNet).  For each use
   case, this document will identify the use case, identify
   representative solutions used today, and describe potential
   improvements that DetNet can enable.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_1">1.  Introduction

</pre><pre class="para">   This memo documents use cases for diverse industries that require
   deterministic flows over multi-hop paths.  Deterministic Networking
   (DetNet) flows can be established from either a Layer 2 or Layer 3
   (IP) interface, and such flows can coexist on an IP network with
   best-effort traffic.  DetNet also provides for highly reliable flows
   through provision for redundant paths.

</pre><pre class="para">   The DetNet use cases explicitly do not suggest any specific design
   for DetNet architecture or protocols; these are topics for other
   DetNet documents.

</pre><pre class="para">   The DetNet use cases, as originally submitted, explicitly were not
   considered by the DetNet Working Group (WG) to be concrete
   requirements.  The DetNet WG and Design Team considered these use
   cases, identifying which of their elements could be feasibly
   implemented within the charter of DetNet; as a result, certain
   originally submitted use cases (or elements thereof) were moved to
   Appendix A ("Use Cases Explicitly Out of Scope for DetNet") of this
   document.

</pre><pre class="para">   This document provides context regarding DetNet design decisions.  It
   also serves a long-lived purpose of helping those learning (or new
   to) DetNet understand the types of applications that can be supported
   by DetNet.  It also allows those WG contributors who are users to
   ensure that their concerns are addressed by the WG; for them, this
   document (1) covers their contributions and (2) provides a long-term
   reference regarding the problems that they expect will be served by
   the technology, in terms of the short-term deliverables and also as
   the technology evolves in the future.

</pre><pre class="para">   This document has served as a "yardstick" against which proposed
   DetNet designs can be measured, answering the question "To what
   extent does a proposed design satisfy these various use cases?"

</pre><pre class="para">   These industries have already transitioned audio and video signals
   from analog to digital.  However, the digital interconnect systems
   remain primarily point to point, with a single signal or a small
   number of signals per link, interconnected with purpose-built
   hardware.

</pre><pre class="para">   These industries are now transitioning to packet-based
   infrastructures to reduce cost, increase routing flexibility, and
   integrate with existing IT infrastructures.

</pre><pre class="para">   Today, ProAV applications have no way to establish deterministic
   flows from a standards-based Layer 3 (IP) interface; this is a
   fundamental limitation of the use cases described here.  Today,
   deterministic flows can be created within standards-based Layer 2
   LANs (e.g., using IEEE 802.1 TSN ("TSN" stands for "Time-Sensitive
   Networking")); however, these flows are not routable via IP and thus
   are not effective for distribution over wider areas (for example,
   broadcast events that span wide geographical areas).

</pre><pre class="para">   It would be highly desirable if such flows could be routed over the
   open Internet; however, solutions of more-limited scope (e.g.,
   enterprise networks) would still provide substantial improvements.

</pre><pre class="para">   The following sections describe specific ProAV use cases.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.1.1">2.1.1.  Uninterrupted Stream Playback

</pre><pre class="para">   Transmitting audio and video streams for live playback is unlike
   common file transfer in that uninterrupted stream playback in the
   presence of network errors cannot be achieved by retrying the
   transmission; by the time the missing or corrupt packet has been
   identified, it is too late to execute a retry operation.  Buffering
   can be used to provide enough delay to allow time for one or more
   retries; however, this is not an effective solution in applications
   where large delays (latencies) are not acceptable (as discussed
   below).

</pre><pre class="para">   Streams with guaranteed bandwidth can eliminate congestion on the
   network as a cause of transmission errors that would lead to playback
   interruption.  The use of redundant paths can further mitigate
   transmission errors and thereby provide greater stream reliability.

</pre><pre class="para">   Additional techniques, such as Forward Error Correction (FEC), can
   also be used to improve stream reliability.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.1.2">2.1.2.  Synchronized Stream Playback

</pre><pre class="para">   Latency in this context is the time between when a signal is
   initially sent over a stream and when it is received.  A common
   example in ProAV is time-synchronizing audio and video when they take
   separate paths through the playback system.  In this case, the
   latency of both the audio stream and the video stream must be bounded
   and consistent if the sound is to remain matched to the movement in
   the video.  A common tolerance for audio/video synchronization is one
   National Television System Committee (NTSC) video frame (about
   33 ms); to maintain the audience's perception of correct lip-sync,
   the latency needs to be consistent within some reasonable tolerance
   -- for example, 10%.

</pre><pre class="para">   A common architecture for synchronizing multiple streams that have
   different paths through the network (and thus potentially different
   latencies) enables measurement of the latency of each path and has
   the data sinks (for example, speakers) delay (buffer) all packets on
   all but the slowest path.  Each packet of each stream is assigned a
   presentation time that is based on the longest required delay.  This
   implies that all sinks must maintain a common time reference of
   sufficient accuracy, which can be achieved by various techniques.

</pre><pre class="para">   This type of architecture is commonly implemented using a central
   controller that determines path delays and arbitrates buffering
   delays.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.1.3">2.1.3.  Sound Reinforcement

</pre><pre class="para">   Consider the latency (delay) between the time when a person speaks
   into a microphone and when their voice emerges from the speaker.  If
   this delay is longer than about 10-15 ms, it is noticeable and can
   make a sound-reinforcement system unusable (see slide 6 of
   [SRP_LATENCY]).  (If you have ever tried to speak in the presence of
   a delayed echo of your voice, you might be familiar with this
   experience.)

</pre><pre class="para">   Note that the 15 ms latency bound includes all parts of the signal
   path -- not just the network -- so the network latency must be
   significantly less than 15 ms.

</pre><pre class="para">   In some cases, local performers must perform in synchrony with a
   remote broadcast.  In such cases, the latencies of the broadcast
   stream and the local performer must be adjusted to match each other,
   with a worst case of one video frame (33 ms for NTSC video).

</pre><pre class="para">   In cases where audio phase is a consideration -- for example,
   beam-forming using multiple speakers -- latency can be in the 10 us

</pre><pre class="para">   Professional audio systems can include amplifiers that are capable of
   generating hundreds or thousands of watts of audio power.  If used
   incorrectly, such amplifiers can cause hearing damage to those in the
   vicinity.  Apart from the usual care required by the systems
   operators to prevent such incidents, the network traffic that
   controls these devices must be secured (as with any sensitive
   application traffic).

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.2">2.2.  Pro Audio Today

</pre><pre class="para">   Some proprietary systems have been created that enable deterministic
   streams at Layer 3; however, they are "engineered networks" that
   require careful configuration to operate and often require that the
   system be over-provisioned.  Also, it is implied that all devices on
   the network voluntarily play by the rules of that network.  To enable
   these industries to successfully transition to an interoperable
   multi-vendor packet-based infrastructure requires effective open
   standards.  Establishing relevant IETF standards is a crucial factor.

</pre><pre class="para">   It would be valuable to enable IP to connect multiple Layer 2 LANs.

</pre><pre class="para">   As an example, ESPN constructed a state-of-the-art 194,000 sq. ft.,
   $125-million broadcast studio called "Digital Center 2" (DC2).  The
   DC2 network is capable of handling 46 Tbps of throughput with 60,000
   simultaneous signals.  Inside the facility are 1,100 miles of fiber
   feeding four audio control rooms (see <a href="https://www.hjp.at/doc/rfc/rfc8578.html#ref_ESPN_DC2" title="   [ESPN_DC2] Daley, D., &quot;ESPN&#39;s DC2 Scales AVB Large&quot;, SVG News,

   they could with packet-based technology.  They constructed seven
   individual studios using Layer 2 LANs (using IEEE 802.1 TSN) that
   were entirely effective at routing audio within the LANs.  However,
   to interconnect these Layer 2 LAN islands together, they ended up
   using dedicated paths in a custom SDN (Software-Defined Networking)
   router because there is no standards-based routing solution
   available.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.2">2.3.2.  High-Reliability Stream Paths

</pre><pre class="para">   On-air and other live media streams are often backed up with
   redundant links that seamlessly act to deliver the content when the
   primary link fails for any reason.  In point-to-point systems, this
   redundancy is provided by an additional point-to-point link; the
   analogous requirement in a packet-based system is to provide an
   alternate path through the network such that no individual link can
   bring down the system.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.3">2.3.3.  Integration of Reserved Streams into IT Networks

</pre><pre class="para">   A commonly cited goal of moving to a packet-based media
   infrastructure is that costs can be reduced by using off-the-shelf,
   commodity-network hardware.  In addition, economy of scale can be
   realized by combining media infrastructure with IT infrastructure.
   In keeping with these goals, stream-reservation technology should be
   compatible with existing protocols and should not compromise the use
   of the network for best-effort (non-time-sensitive) traffic.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.4">2.3.4.  Use of Unused Reservations by Best-Effort Traffic

</pre><pre class="para">   In cases where stream bandwidth is reserved but not currently used
   (or is underutilized), that bandwidth must be available to
   best-effort (i.e., non-time-sensitive) traffic.  For example, a
   single stream may be "nailed up" (reserved) for specific media
   content that needs to be presented at different times of the day,
   ensuring timely delivery of that content, yet in between those times
   the full bandwidth of the network can be utilized for best-effort
   tasks such as file transfers.

</pre><pre class="para">   This also addresses a concern of IT network administrators that are
   considering adding reserved-bandwidth traffic to their networks that
   "users will reserve large quantities of bandwidth and then never
   unreserve it even though they are not using it, and soon the network
   will have no bandwidth left."

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.5">2.3.5.  Traffic Segregation

</pre><pre class="para">   Sink devices may be low-cost devices with limited processing power.
   In order to not overwhelm the CPUs in these devices, it is important
   to limit the amount of traffic that these devices must process.

</pre><pre class="para">   As an example, consider the use of individual seat speakers in a
   cinema.  These speakers are typically required to be cost reduced,
   since the quantities in a single theater can reach hundreds of seats.
   Discovery protocols alone in a 1,000-seat theater can generate enough
   broadcast traffic to overwhelm a low-powered CPU.  Thus, an

</pre><pre class="para">   installation like this will benefit greatly from some type of traffic
   segregation that can define groups of seats to reduce traffic within
   each group.  All seats in the theater must still be able to
   communicate with a central controller.

</pre><pre class="para">   There are many techniques that can be used to support this feature,
   including (but not limited to) the following examples.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.5.1">2.3.5.1.  Packet-Forwarding Rules, VLANs, and Subnets

</pre><pre class="para">   Packet-forwarding rules can be used to eliminate some extraneous
   streaming traffic from reaching potentially low-powered sink devices;
   however, there may be other types of broadcast traffic that should be
   eliminated via other means -- for example, VLANs or IP subnets.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.5.2">2.3.5.2.  Multicast Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)

</pre><pre class="para">   Multicast addressing is commonly used to keep bandwidth utilization
   of shared links to a minimum.

</pre><pre class="para">   Because Layer 2 bridges by design forward Media Access Control (MAC)
   addresses, it is important that a multicast MAC address only be
   associated with one stream.  This will prevent reservations from
   forwarding packets from one stream down a path that has no interested
   sinks simply because there is another stream on that same path that
   shares the same multicast MAC address.

</pre><pre class="para">   In other words, since each multicast MAC address can represent 32
   different IPv4 multicast addresses, there must be a process in place
   to make sure that any given multicast MAC address is only associated
   with exactly one IPv4 multicast address.  Requiring the use of IPv6
   addresses could help in this regard, due to the much larger address
   range of IPv6; however, due to the continued prevalence of IPv4
   installations, solutions that are effective for IPv4 installations
   would be practical in many more use cases.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.6">2.3.6.  Latency Optimization by a Central Controller

</pre><pre class="para">   A central network controller might also perform optimizations based
   on the individual path delays; for example, sinks that are closer to
   the source can inform the controller that they can accept greater
   latency, since they will be buffering packets to match presentation
   times of sinks that are farther away.  The controller might then move
   a stream reservation on a short path to a longer path in order to
   free up bandwidth for other critical streams on that short path.  See
   slides 3-5 of [SRP_LATENCY].

</pre><pre class="para">   Additional optimization can be achieved in cases where sinks have
   differing latency requirements; for example, at a live outdoor
   concert, the speaker sinks have stricter latency requirements than
   the recording-hardware sinks.  See slide 7 of [SRP_LATENCY].

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_2.3.7">2.3.7.  Reduced Device Costs due to Reduced Buffer Memory

</pre><pre class="para">   Device costs can be reduced in a system with guaranteed reservations
   with a small bounded latency due to the reduced requirements for
   buffering (i.e., memory) on sink devices.  For example, a theme park
   might broadcast a live event across the globe via a Layer 3 protocol.
   In such cases, the size of the buffers required is defined by the
   worst-case latency and jitter values of the worst-case segment of the
   end-to-end network path.  For example, on today's open Internet, the
   latency is typically unacceptable for audio and video streaming
   without many seconds of buffering.  In such scenarios, a single
   gateway device at the local network that receives the feed from the
   remote site would provide the expensive buffering required to mask
   the latency and jitter issues associated with long-distance delivery.
   Sink devices in the local location would have no additional buffering
   requirements, and thus no additional costs, beyond those required for
   delivery of local content.  The sink device would be receiving
   packets identical to those sent by the source and would be unaware of
   any latency or jitter issues along the path.

   Standard 60834 [IEC-60834] as follows:

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Transmission time (speed): The time between the moment when a
      state change occurs at the transmitter input and the moment of the
      corresponding change at the receiver output, including propagation
      delay.  The overall operating time for a teleprotection system is
      the sum of (1) the time required to initiate the command at the
      transmitting end, (2) the propagation delay over the network
      (including equipment), and (3) the time required to make the
      necessary selections and decisions at the receiving end, including
      any additional delay due to a noisy environment.

      the presence of interference and/or noise, by minimizing the
      Probability of Missing Commands (PMC).  Dependability targets are

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_3.1.1.1.2">3.1.1.1.2.  Fault Detection and Clearance Timing

</pre><pre class="para">   Most power-line equipment can tolerate short circuits or faults for
   up to approximately five power cycles before sustaining irreversible
   damage or affecting other segments in the network.  This translates
   to a total fault clearance time of 100 ms.  As a safety precaution,
   however, the actual operation time of protection systems is limited
   to 70-80% of this period, including fault recognition time, command
   transmission time, and line breaker switching time.

</pre><pre class="para">   Some system components, such as large electromechanical switches,
   require a particularly long time to operate and take up the majority
   of the total clearance time, leaving only a 10 ms window for the
   telecommunications part of the protection scheme, independent of the
   distance of travel.  Given the sensitivity of the issue, new
   networks impose requirements that are even more stringent: IEC
   Standard 61850-5:2013 [IEC-61850-5:2013] limits the transfer time for
   protection messages to 1/4-1/2 cycle or 4-8 ms (for 60 Hz lines) for
   messages considered the most critical.

</pre><pre class="para">   Teleprotection channels that are differential must be synchronous;
   this means that any delays on the transmit and receive paths must
   match each other.  Ideally, teleprotection systems support zero
   asymmetric delay; typical legacy relays can tolerate delay
   discrepancies of up to 750 us.

</pre><pre class="para">   Some tools available for lowering delay variation below this
   threshold are as follows:

</pre><pre class="para">   o  For legacy systems using Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM), jitter
      buffers at the multiplexers on each end of the line can be used to
      offset delay variation by queuing sent and received packets.  The
      length of the queues must balance the need to regulate the rate of
      transmission with the need to limit overall delay, as larger
      buffers result in increased latency.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  For jitter-prone IP networks, traffic management tools can ensure
      that the teleprotection signals receive the highest transmission
      priority to minimize jitter.

</pre><pre class="para">   The application of synchrophasor measurement data from Phasor
   Measurement Units (PMUs) to wide-area monitoring and control systems
   promises to provide important new capabilities for improving system
   stability.  Access to PMU data enables more-timely situational
   awareness over larger portions of the grid than what has been
   possible historically with normal SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
   Acquisition) data.  Handling the volume and the real-time nature of
   synchrophasor data presents unique challenges for existing
   application architectures.  The Wide-Area Management System (WAMS)
   makes it possible for the condition of the bulk power system to be
   observed and understood in real time so that protective,
   preventative, or corrective action can be taken.  Because of the very
   high sampling rate of measurements and the strict requirement for
   time synchronization of the samples, the WAMS has stringent
   telecommunications requirements in an IP network, as captured in

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_3.2.1">3.2.1.  Current Security Practices and Their Limitations

</pre><pre class="para">   Grid-monitoring and control devices are already targets for cyber
   attacks, and legacy telecommunications protocols have many intrinsic
   network-related vulnerabilities.  For example, the Distributed
   Network Protocol (DNP3) [IEEE-1815], Modbus, PROFIBUS/PROFINET, and
   other protocols are designed around a common paradigm of "request and
   respond".  Each protocol is designed for a master device such as an
   HMI (Human-Machine Interface) system to send commands to subordinate
   slave devices to perform data retrieval (reading inputs) or control
   functions (writing to outputs).  Because many of these protocols lack
   authentication, encryption, or other basic security measures, they
   are prone to network-based attacks, allowing a malicious actor or
   attacker to utilize the request-and-respond system as a mechanism for
   functionality similar to command and control.  Specific security
   concerns common to most industrial-control protocols (including
   utility telecommunications protocols) include the following:

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Network or transport errors (e.g., malformed packets or excessive
      latency) can cause protocol failure.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of forcing
      slave devices into inoperable states, including powering devices
      off, forcing them into a listen-only state, or disabling alarming.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of
      interrupting processes (e.g., restarting communications).

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of clearing,
      erasing, or resetting diagnostic information such as counters and
      diagnostic registers.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of requesting
      sensitive information about the controllers, their configurations,
      or other need-to-know information.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Most protocols are application-layer protocols transported over
      TCP; it is therefore easy to transport commands over non-standard
      ports or inject commands into authorized traffic flows.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Protocol commands may be available that are capable of
      broadcasting messages to many devices at once (i.e., a

</pre><pre class="para">   These inherent vulnerabilities, along with increasing connectivity
   between IT and OT networks, make network-based attacks very feasible.
   By injecting malicious protocol commands, an attacker could take
   control over the target process.  Altering legitimate protocol
   traffic can also alter information about a process and disrupt the
   legitimate controls that are in place over that process.  A
   man-in-the-middle attack could result in (1) improper control over a
   process and (2) misrepresentation of data that is sent back to
   operator consoles.

   is a drive to modernize the electrical grid with an integrated
   telecommunications infrastructure.  However, interoperability
   concerns, legacy networks, disparate tools, and stringent security
   requirements all add complexity to the grid's transformation.  Given
   the range and diversity of the requirements that should be addressed

   technology development, facilitating interoperability and device
   management across disparate networks and devices, as has already been

</pre><pre class="para">   Utilities often have very large private telecommunications networks
   that can cover an entire territory/country.  Until now, the main
   purposes of these networks have been to (1) support transmission
   network monitoring, control, and automation, (2) support remote
   control of generation sites, and (3) provide FCAPS (Fault,
   Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security) services from
   centralized network operation centers.

</pre><pre class="para">   Going forward, one network will support the operation and maintenance
   of electrical networks (generation, transmission, and distribution),
   voice and data services for tens of thousands of employees and for
   exchanges with neighboring interconnections, and administrative
   services.  To meet those requirements, a utility may deploy several
   physical networks leveraging different technologies across the
   country -- for instance, an optical network and a microwave network.
   Each protection and automation system between two points has two
   telecommunications circuits, one on each network.  Path diversity
   between two substations is key.  Regardless of the event type
   (hurricane, ice storm, etc.), one path needs to stay available so the
   system can still operate.

</pre><pre class="para">   In the optical network, signals are transmitted over more than tens
   of thousands of circuits using fiber optic links, microwave links,
   and telephone cables.  This network is the nervous system of the
   utility's power transmission operations.  The optical network
   represents tens of thousands of kilometers of cable deployed along
   the power lines, with individual runs as long as 280 km.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_3.3.2.3">3.3.2.3.  Precision Time Protocol

</pre><pre class="para">   Some utilities do not use GPS clocks in generation substations.  One
   of the main reasons is that some of the generation plants are 30 to
   50 meters deep underground and the GPS signal can be weak and
   unreliable.  Instead, atomic clocks are used.  Clocks are
   synchronized amongst each other.  Rubidium clocks provide clock and
   1 ms timestamps for IRIG-B.

</pre><pre class="para">   Some companies plan to transition to PTP [IEEE-1588], distributing

</pre><pre class="para">   PTP operates based on the following assumptions:

</pre><pre class="para">   o  The network eliminates cyclic forwarding of PTP messages within
      each communication path (e.g., by using a spanning tree protocol).

</pre><pre class="para">   o  PTP is tolerant of an occasional missed message, duplicated
      message, or message that arrived out of order.  However, PTP
      assumes that such impairments are relatively rare.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  As designed, PTP expects a multicast communication model; however,
      PTP also supports a unicast communication model as long as the
      behavior of the protocol is preserved.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Like all message-based time transfer protocols, PTP time accuracy
      is degraded by delay asymmetry in the paths taken by event
      messages.  PTP cannot detect asymmetry, but if such delays are
      known a priori, time values can be adjusted to correct for
      asymmetry.

</pre><pre class="para">   The use of PTP for power automation is defined in

</pre><pre class="para">   "Cybersecurity" refers to all the security issues in automation and

   security for the smart grid is not just an ad hoc feature or product;
   it's a complete framework integrating both physical and cybersecurity
   requirements and covering the entire smart-grid networks from
   generation to distribution.  Security has therefore become one of the
   main foundations of the utility telecom network architecture and must
   be considered at every layer with a defense-in-depth approach.

   configuring paths through the network.  Specifically, what is needed
   is a protocol and data model that the PCE will use to get/set the
   relevant configuration from/to the devices, as well as perform
   operations on the devices.  Specifically, both DetNet and 6TiSCH need
   to develop a protocol (and associated data model) that the PCE can
   use to (1) get/set the relevant configuration from/to the devices and
   (2) perform operations on the devices.  These could be initially
   developed by DetNet, with consideration for their reuse by 6TiSCH.

   For instance, it is possible that a mapping entity on the backbone
   transforms a non-CoAP protocol such as the Path Computation Element
   Communication Protocol (PCEP) into the RESTful interfaces that the
   6TiSCH devices support.  This architecture will be refined to comply
   with DetNet [DetNet-Arch] when the work is formalized.  Related
   information about 6TiSCH can be found in [Interface-6TiSCH-6top] and

   has ceased to perform as expected, but in 6TiSCH that flow was not
   designed and no protocol was selected.  DetNet should define the
   appropriate end-to-end protocols to be used in that case.  The
   implication is that these state updates take place once the system is
   configured and running, i.e., they are not limited to the initial
   communication of the configuration of the system.

   implies that an extensible protocol for communicating device
   information to the PCE and enabling the PCE to act on it will be part

   PCE.  DetNet should define such a protocol; one possible design
   alternative is that it could operate over CoAP.  Alternatively, it
   could be converted to/from CoAP by a gateway.  Such a protocol could
   carry multiple metrics -- for example, metrics similar to those used

   limited to the available time after the baseband processing of the

   typically the baseband processing uses most of it, allowing only a
   small fraction to be used by the Fronthaul network.  In this example,
   out of 3 ms, the maximum time allocated to the Fronthaul network for
   one-way delay is 250 us, and the existing specification [NGMN-Fronth]
   specifies a maximum delay of only 100 us.  This ultimately determines
   the distance the RRHs can be located from the base stations (e.g.,
   100 us equals roughly 20 km of optical fiber-based transport).
   Allocation options regarding the available time budget between
   processing and transport are currently undergoing heavy discussion in

</pre><pre class="para">   The transport time budget, as noted above, places limitations on the
   distance that RRHs can be located from base stations (i.e., the link
   length).  In the above analysis, it is assumed that the entire
   transport time budget is available for link propagation delay.
   However, the transport time budget can be broken down into three
   components: scheduling/queuing delay, transmission delay, and link
   propagation delay.  Using today's Fronthaul networking technology,
   the queuing, scheduling, and transmission components might become the
   dominant factors in the total transport time, rather than the link
   propagation delay.  This is especially true in cases where the
   Fronthaul link is relatively short and is shared among multiple
   Fronthaul flows -- for example, in indoor and small-cell networks,
   massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna networks, and
   split Fronthaul architectures.

</pre><pre class="para">   DetNet technology can improve Fronthaul networks by controlling and
   reducing the time required for the queuing, scheduling, and
   transmission operations by properly assigning network resources, thus
   (1) leaving more of the transport time budget available for link
   propagation and (2) enabling longer link lengths.  However, link
   length is usually a predetermined parameter and is not a controllable
   network parameter, since RRH and BBU sites are usually located in
   predetermined locations.  However, the number of antennas in an RRH
   site might increase -- for example, by adding more antennas,
   increasing the MIMO capability of the network, or adding support for
   massive MIMO.  This means increasing the number of Fronthaul flows
   sharing the same Fronthaul link.  DetNet can now control the
   bandwidth assignment of the Fronthaul link and the scheduling of
   Fronthaul packets over this link and can provide adequate buffer
   provisioning for each flow to reduce the packet loss rate.

</pre><pre class="para">   Another way in which DetNet technology can aid Fronthaul networks is
   by providing effective isolation between flows -- for example,
   between flows originating in different slices within a network-sliced

   flows for which resources have been preallocated, i.e., it does not
   apply to best-effort flows within a DetNet.  DetNet technology can

      the radio unit to the RRH.  The RRH is essentially a passive
      device (e.g., without buffering).  The transport drives the
      antenna directly by feeding it with samples, and everything the
      transport adds will be introduced to the radio "as is".  So, if
      the transport causes any additional frequency errors, the errors
      will show up immediately on the radio as well.  Note that
      performance guarantees of low-nanosecond values such as these are
      considered to be below the DetNet layer -- it is assumed that the
      underlying implementation (e.g., the hardware) will provide
      sufficient support to enable this level of performance.  These
      values are maintained in the use case to give an indication of the
      overall application.

   requirements in every intermediate node is likely to be too costly.

   to the legacy CPRI split, which is option 8 in 3GPP), lower-layer
   splits may imply an FLR of less than 10^-7 for data traffic and less

   and Midhaul networks have serious challenges; for example,
   retransmitting lost packets or using FEC to circumvent bit errors (or

   incurred.  Using redundant streams for better guarantees of delivery
   is also practically impossible in many cases, due to high bandwidth
   requirements for Fronthaul and Midhaul networks.  Protection
   switching is also a candidate, but at the time of this writing,
   available technologies for the path switch are too slow to avoid a

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_7.2">7.2.  Industrial M2M Communications Today

</pre><pre class="para">   Today, proprietary networks fulfill the needed timing and
   availability for M2M networks.

</pre><pre class="para">   The network topologies used today by industrial automation are
   similar to those used by telecom networks: daisy chain, ring,
   hub-and-spoke, and "comb" (a subset of daisy chain).

</pre><pre class="para">   PLC-related control/data streams are transmitted periodically and
   carry either a preconfigured payload or a payload configured during
   runtime.

</pre><pre class="para">   Some industrial applications require time synchronization at the end
   nodes.  For such time-coordinated PLCs, accuracy of 1 us is required.
   Even in the case of "non-time-coordinated" PLCs, time synchronization
   may be needed, e.g., for timestamping of sensor data.

</pre><pre class="para">   Industrial-network scenarios require advanced security solutions.  At
   the time of this writing, many industrial production networks are
   physically separated.  Filtering policies that are typically enforced
   in firewalls are used to prevent critical flows from being leaked
   outside a domain.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_7.2.1">7.2.1.  Transport Parameters

</pre><pre class="para">   The cycle time defines the frequency of message(s) between industrial
   actors.  The cycle time is application dependent, in the range of
   1-100 ms for critical control/data streams.

</pre><pre class="para">   Because industrial applications assume that deterministic transport
   will be used for critical control-data-stream parameters (instead of
   having to define latency and delay-variation parameters), it is
   sufficient to fulfill requirements regarding the upper bound of
   latency (maximum latency).  The underlying networking infrastructure
   must ensure a maximum end-to-end message delivery time in the range
   of 100 us to 50 ms, depending on the control-loop application.

</pre><pre class="para">   The bandwidth requirements of control/data streams are usually
   calculated directly from the bytes-per-cycle parameter of the control
   loop.  For PLC-to-PLC communication, one can expect 2-32 streams with
   packet sizes in the range of 100-700 bytes.  For S-PLC-to-PLC
   communication, the number of streams is higher -- up to 256 streams.
   Usually, no more than 20% of available bandwidth is used for
   critical control/data streams.  In today's networks, 1 Gbps links
   are commonly used.

</pre><pre class="para">   Most PLC control loops are rather tolerant of packet loss; however,
   critical control/data streams accept a loss of no more than one
   packet per consecutive communication cycle (i.e., if a packet gets
   lost in cycle "n", then the next cycle ("n+1") must be lossless).
   After the loss of two or more consecutive packets, the network may be
   considered to be "down" by the application.

</pre><pre class="para">   As network downtime may impact the whole production system, the
   required network availability is rather high (99.999%).

</pre><pre class="para">   Based on the above parameters, some form of redundancy will be
   required for M2M communications; however, any individual solution
   depends on several parameters, including cycle time and
   delivery time.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_7.2.2">7.2.2.  Stream Creation and Destruction

</pre><pre class="para">   In an industrial environment, critical control/data streams are
   created rather infrequently, on the order of ~10 times per
   day/week/month.  Most of these critical control/data streams get
   created at machine startup; however, flexibility is also needed
   during runtime -- for example, when adding or removing a machine.  As
   production systems become more flexible going forward, there will be
   a significant increase in the rate at which streams are created,
   changed, and destroyed.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_8.1">8.1.  Use Case Description

</pre><pre class="para">   The mining industry is highly dependent on networks to monitor and
   control their systems, in both open-pit and underground extraction as
   well as in transport and refining processes.  In order to reduce
   risks and increase operational efficiency in mining operations, the
   location of operators has been relocated (as much as possible) from
   the extraction site to remote control and monitoring sites.

</pre><pre class="para">   In the case of open-pit mining, autonomous trucks are used to
   transport the raw materials from the open pit to the refining factory
   where the final product (e.g., copper) is obtained.  Although the
   operation is autonomous, the tracks are remotely monitored from a
   central facility.

</pre><pre class="para">   In pit mines, the monitoring of the tailings or mine dumps is
   critical in order to minimize environmental pollution.  In the past,
   monitoring was conducted through manual inspection of preinstalled
   dataloggers.  Cabling is not typically used in such scenarios, due to
   its high cost and complex deployment requirements.  At the time of
   this writing, wireless technologies are being employed to monitor
   these cases permanently.  Slopes are also monitored in order to
   anticipate possible mine collapse.  Due to the unstable terrain,
   cable maintenance is costly and complex; hence, wireless technologies
   are employed.

</pre><pre class="para">   In the case of underground monitoring, autonomous vehicles with
   extraction tools travel independently through the tunnels, but their
   operational tasks (such as excavation, stone-breaking, and transport)
   are controlled remotely from a central facility.  This generates
   upstream video and feedback traffic plus downstream actuator-control
   traffic.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_8.2">8.2.  Mining Industry Today

</pre><pre class="para">   At the time of this writing, the mining industry uses a
   packet-switched architecture supported by high-speed Ethernet.
   However, in order to comply with requirements regarding delay and
   packet loss, the network bandwidth is overestimated.  This results in
   very low efficiency in terms of resource usage.

</pre><pre class="para">   Since mobility is involved in this process, the connections between
   the backbone and the mobile devices (e.g., trucks, trains, and
   excavators) are implemented using a wireless link.  These links are
   based on IEEE 802.11 [IEEE-80211] for open-pit mining and "leaky
   feeder" communications for underground mining.  (A "leaky feeder"
   communication system consists of a coaxial cable, run along tunnels,
   that emits and receives radio waves, functioning as an extended
   antenna.  The cable is "leaky" in that it has gaps or slots in its
   outer conductor to allow the radio signal to leak into or out of the
   cable along its entire length.)

</pre><pre class="para">   Lately, in pit mines the use of Low-Power WAN (LPWAN) technologies
   has been extended: tailings, slopes, and mine dumps are monitored by
   battery-powered dataloggers that make use of robust long-range radio
   technologies.  Reliability is usually ensured through retransmissions
   at Layer 2.  Gateways or concentrators act as bridges, forwarding the
   data to the backbone Ethernet network.  Deterministic requirements
   are biased towards reliability rather than latency, as events are
   triggered slowly or can be anticipated in advance.

</pre><pre class="para">   At the mineral-processing stage, conveyor belts and refining
   processes are controlled by a SCADA system that provides an
   in-factory delay-constrained networking environment.

</pre><pre class="para">   At the time of this writing, voice communications are served by a
   redundant trunking infrastructure, independent from data networks.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_8.3">8.3.  Mining Industry in the Future

</pre><pre class="para">   Mining operations and management are converging towards a combination
   of autonomous operation and teleoperation of transport and extraction
   machines.  This means that video, audio, monitoring, and process-
   control traffic will increase dramatically.  Ideally, all activities
   at the mine will rely on network infrastructure.

</pre><pre class="para">   Wireless for open-pit mining is already a reality with LPWAN
   technologies; it is expected to evolve to more-advanced LPWAN
   technologies, such as those based on LTE, to increase last-hop
   reliability or novel LPWAN flavors with deterministic access.

</pre><pre class="para">   One area in which DetNet can improve this use case is in the wired
   networks that make up the "backbone network" of the system.  These

   open Internet; however, blockchain has also spread far beyond its
   original host into various industries, such as smart manufacturing,
   logistics, security, legal rights, and others.  In these industries,

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_9.1.1">9.1.1.  Blockchain Operation

</pre><pre class="para">   A "block" runs as a container of a batch of primary items (e.g.,
   transactions, property records).  The blocks are chained in such a
   way that the hash of the previous block works as the pointer to the
   header of the new block.  Confirmation of each block requires a
   consensus mechanism.  When an item arrives at a blockchain node, the
   latter broadcasts this item to the rest of the nodes, which receive
   it, verify it, and put it in the ongoing block.  The block
   confirmation process begins as the number of items reaches the
   predefined block capacity, at which time the node broadcasts its
   proved block to the rest of the nodes, to be verified and chained.
   The result is that block N+1 of each chain transitively vouches for
   blocks N and previous of that chain.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_9.1.2">9.1.2.  Blockchain Network Architecture

</pre><pre class="para">   Blockchain node communication and coordination are achieved mainly
   through frequent point-to-multipoint communication; however,
   persistent point-to-point connections are used to transport both the
   items and the blocks to the other nodes.  For example, consider the
   following implementation.

</pre><pre class="para">   When a node is initiated, it first requests the other nodes'
   addresses from a specific entity, such as DNS.  The node then creates
   persistent connections with each of the other nodes.  If a node
   confirms an item, it sends the item to the other nodes via these
   persistent connections.

</pre><pre class="para">   As a new block in a node is completed and is proven by the
   surrounding nodes, it propagates towards its neighbor nodes.  When
   node A receives a block, it verifies it and then sends an invite
   message to its neighbor B.  Neighbor B checks to see if the
   designated block is available and responds to A if it is unavailable;
   A then sends the complete block to B.  B repeats the process (as was
   done by A) to start the next round of block propagation.

</pre><pre class="para">   The challenge of blockchain network operation is not overall data
   rates, since the volume from both the block and the item stays
   between hundreds of bytes and a couple of megabytes per second;
   rather, the challenge is in transporting the blocks with minimum
   latency to maximize the efficiency of the blockchain consensus
   process.  The efficiency of differing implementations of the
   consensus process may be affected to a differing degree by the
   latency (and variation of latency) of the network.

   play a leading role in preventing both double-spending and malicious
   service attacks.  However, there is concern that in the proposed use

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_10.1">10.1.  Use Case Description

</pre><pre class="para">   Network slicing divides one physical network infrastructure into
   multiple logical networks.  Each slice, which corresponds to a
   logical network, uses resources and network functions independently
   from each other.  Network slicing provides flexibility of resource
   allocation and service quality customization.

</pre><pre class="para">   Future services will demand network performance with a wide variety
   of characteristics such as high data rate, low latency, low loss
   rate, security, and many other parameters.  Ideally, every service
   would have its own physical network satisfying its particular
   performance requirements; however, that would be prohibitively
   expensive.  Network slicing can provide a customized slice for a
   single service, and multiple slices can share the same physical
   network.  This method can optimize performance for the service at
   lower cost, and the flexibility of setting up and releasing the
   slices also allows the user to allocate network resources
   dynamically.

</pre><pre class="para">   Unlike the other use cases presented here, network slicing is not a

</pre><pre class="para">   One of the requirements discussed for network slicing is the "hard"
   separation of various users' deterministic performance.  That is, it
   should be impossible for activity, lack of activity, or changes in
   activity of one or more users to have any appreciable effect on the
   deterministic performance parameters of any other slices.  Typical
   techniques used today, which share a physical network among users, do
   not offer this level of isolation.  DetNet can supply point-to-point
   or point-to-multipoint paths that offer a user bandwidth and latency
   guarantees that cannot be affected by other users' data traffic.
   Thus, DetNet is a powerful tool when reliability and low latency are
   required in network slicing.

   provide service guarantees and isolation to its users without any
   particular DetNet awareness on the part of the users' applications.

   guarantees.  Another issue is that the number of flows that can be
   carried by DetNet is limited by DetNet scalability; flow aggregation
   and queuing management modification may help address this issue.
   Additional work and discussion are needed to address these topics.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11">11.  Use Case Common Themes

</pre><pre class="para">   This section summarizes the expected properties of a DetNet network,
   based on the use cases as described in this document.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1">11.1.  Unified, Standards-Based Networks

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1.1">11.1.1.  Extensions to Ethernet

</pre><pre class="para">   A DetNet network is not "a new kind of network" -- it is based on
   extensions to existing Ethernet standards, including elements of
   IEEE 802.1 TSN and related standards.  Presumably, it will be
   possible to run DetNet over other underlying transports besides
   Ethernet, but Ethernet is explicitly supported.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1.2">11.1.2.  Centrally Administered Networks

</pre><pre class="para">   In general, a DetNet network is not expected to be "plug and play";
   rather, some type of centralized network configuration and control
   system is expected.  Such a system may be in a single central
   location, or it may be distributed across multiple control entities
   that function together as a unified control system for the network.
   However, the ability to "hot swap" components (e.g., due to
   malfunction) is similar enough to "plug and play" that this kind of
   behavior may be expected in DetNet networks, depending on the
   implementation.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1.3">11.1.3.  Standardized Data-Flow Information Models

</pre><pre class="para">   Data-flow information models to be used with DetNet networks are to
   be specified by DetNet.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1.4">11.1.4.  Layer 2 and Layer 3 Integration

</pre><pre class="para">   A DetNet network is intended to integrate between Layer 2 (bridged)
   network(s) (e.g., an AVB/TSN LAN) and Layer 3 (routed) network(s)
   (e.g., using IP-based protocols).  One example of this is making
   AVB/TSN-type deterministic performance available from Layer 3
   applications, e.g., using RTP.  Another example is connecting two
   AVB/TSN LANs ("islands") together through a standard router.

</pre><pre class="para">   This document explicitly does not specify any particular

   not every feature of DetNet is available in an IPv4 context, at least
   some of the significant benefits (such as guaranteed end-to-end
   delivery and low latency) will be available.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.1.6">11.1.6.  Guaranteed End-to-End Delivery

</pre><pre class="para">   Packets in a DetNet flow are guaranteed not to be dropped by the
   network due to congestion.  However, the network may drop packets for
   intended reasons, e.g., per security measures.  Similarly,
   best-effort traffic on a DetNet is subject to being dropped (as on a
   non-DetNet IP network).  Also note that this guarantee applies to
   actions taken by DetNet protocol software and does not provide any
   guarantee against lower-level errors such as media errors or checksum
   errors.

</pre><pre class="para">   There are many proprietary non-interoperable deterministic Ethernet-

   open-standards-based alternative to such networks.

         Traffic

</pre><pre class="para">   If bandwidth reservations are made for a stream but the associated
   bandwidth is not used at any point in time, that bandwidth is made
   available on the network for best-effort traffic.  If the owner of
   the reserved stream then starts transmitting again, the bandwidth is
   no longer available for best-effort traffic; this occurs on a
   moment-to-moment basis.  Note that such "temporarily available"
   bandwidth is not available for time-sensitive traffic, which must
   have its own reservation.

   DetNet networks at lower cost and with greater diversity of available
   devices than existing proprietary networks.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.2">11.2.  Scalable Size

</pre><pre class="para">   DetNet networks range in size from very small (e.g., inside a single
   industrial machine) to very large (e.g., a utility-grid network
   spanning a whole country and involving many "hops" over various kinds
   of links -- for example, radio repeaters, microwave links, or fiber
   optic links).  However, recall that the scope of DetNet is confined
   to networks that are centrally administered and thereby explicitly
   excludes unbounded decentralized networks such as the Internet.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.2.1">11.2.1.  Scalable Number of Flows

</pre><pre class="para">   The number of flows in a given network application can potentially be
   large and can potentially grow faster than the number of nodes and
   hops, so the network should provide a sufficient (perhaps
   configurable) maximum number of flows for any given application.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.3">11.3.  Scalable Timing Parameters and Accuracy

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.3.1">11.3.1.  Bounded Latency

</pre><pre class="para">   DetNet data-flow information models are expected to provide means to
   configure the network that include parameters for querying network
   path latency, requesting bounded latency for a given stream,
   requesting worst-case maximum and/or minimum latency for a given path
   or stream, and so on.  It is expected that the network may not be
   able to provide a given requested service level; if this is indeed
   the case, the network control system should reply that the requested
   services are not available (as opposed to accepting the parameter but
   then not delivering the desired behavior).

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.3.2">11.3.2.  Low Latency

</pre><pre class="para">   Various applications may state that they require "extremely low
   latency"; however, depending on the application, "extremely low" may
   imply very different latency bounds.  For example, "low latency"
   across a utility-grid network is a different order of magnitude of
   latency values compared to "low latency" in a motor control loop in a
   small machine.  It is intended that the mechanisms for specifying
   desired latency include wide ranges and that architecturally there is
   nothing to prevent arbitrarily low latencies from being implemented
   in a given network.

</pre><pre class="para">   Some applications would like to specify that the transit delay time
   values be equal for both the transmit path and the return path.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.4">11.4.  High Reliability and Availability

</pre><pre class="para">   Reliability is of critical importance to many DetNet applications,
   because the consequences of failure can be extraordinarily high in
   terms of cost and even human life.  DetNet-based systems are expected
   to be implemented with essentially arbitrarily high availability --
   for example, 99.9999% uptime (where 99.9999 means "six nines") or
   even 12 nines.  DetNet designs should not make any assumptions about
   the level of reliability and availability that may be required of a
   given system and should define parameters for communicating these
   kinds of metrics within the network.

</pre><pre class="para">   A strategy used by DetNet for providing such extraordinarily high
   levels of reliability is to provide redundant paths so that a system
   can seamlessly switch between the paths while maintaining its
   required level of performance.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.5">11.5.  Security

</pre><pre class="para">   Security is of critical importance to many DetNet applications.  A
   DetNet network must have the ability to be made secure against device
   failures, attackers, misbehaving devices, and so on.  In a DetNet
   network, the data traffic is expected to be time sensitive; thus, in
   addition to arriving with the data content as intended, the data must
   also arrive at the expected time.  This may present "new" security
   challenges to implementers and must be addressed accordingly.  There
   are other security implications, including (but not limited to) the
   change in attack surface presented by PRE.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_11.6">11.6.  Deterministic Flows

</pre><pre class="para">   Reserved-bandwidth data flows must be isolated from each other and
   from best-effort traffic, so that even if the network is saturated
   with best-effort (and/or reserved-bandwidth) traffic, the configured
   flows are not adversely affected.

</pre><pre class="para">Appendix A.  Use Cases Explicitly Out of Scope for DetNet

</pre><pre class="para">   This appendix contains text regarding use cases that have been
   determined to be outside the scope of the present DetNet work.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.1">A.1.  DetNet Scope Limitations

</pre><pre class="para">   The scope of DetNet is deliberately limited to specific use cases
   that are consistent with the WG charter, subject to the
   interpretation of the WG.  At the time that the DetNet use cases were
   solicited and provided by the authors, the scope of DetNet was not
   clearly defined.  As the scope has been clarified, certain use cases
   have been determined to be outside the scope of the present DetNet
   work.  Text regarding these use cases was moved to this appendix to
   clarify that they will not be supported by the DetNet work.

</pre><pre class="para">   The text was moved to this appendix based on the following
   "exclusion" principles.  Please note that as an alternative to moving
   all such text to this appendix some text has been modified in situ to
   reflect these same principles.

</pre><pre class="para">   The following principles have been established to clarify the scope
   of the present DetNet work.

</pre><pre class="para">   o  The scope of networks addressed by DetNet is limited to networks
      that can be centrally controlled, i.e., an "enterprise" (aka
      "corporate") network.  This explicitly excludes "the open
      Internet".

</pre><pre class="para">   o  Maintaining time synchronization across a DetNet network is
      crucial to its operation; however, DetNet assumes that time is to
      be maintained using other means.  One example would be PTP
      [IEEE-1588].  A use case may state the accuracy and reliability
      that it expects from the DetNet network as part of a whole system;
      however, it is understood that such timing properties are not
      guaranteed by DetNet itself.  At the time of this writing, two
      open questions remain: (1) whether DetNet protocols will include a
      way for an application to communicate expectations regarding such
      timing properties to the network and (2) if so, whether those
      properties would likely have a material effect on network
      performance as a result.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.2">A.2.  Internet-Based Applications

</pre><pre class="para">   There are many applications that communicate over the open Internet
   that could benefit from guaranteed delivery and bounded latency.
   However, as noted above, all such applications, when run over the
   open Internet, are out of scope for DetNet.  These same applications

</pre><pre class="para">   Media content delivery continues to be an important use of the

   to the delay and jitter inherent in today's Internet.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.2.1.2">A.2.1.2.  Online Gaming

</pre><pre class="para">   Online gaming is a significant part of the gaming market; however,
   latency can degrade the end user's experience.  For example, "First
   Person Shooter" (FPS) games are highly delay sensitive.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.2.1.3">A.2.1.3.  Virtual Reality

</pre><pre class="para">   VR has many commercial applications, including real estate
   presentations, remote medical procedures, and so on.  Low latency is
   critical to interacting with the virtual world, because perceptual
   delays can cause motion sickness.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.2.2">A.2.2.  Internet-Based Applications Today

</pre><pre class="para">   Internet service today is by definition "best effort", with no
   guarantees regarding delivery or bandwidth.

</pre><pre class="para" id="sec_A.2.3">A.2.3.  Internet-Based Applications in the Future

</pre><pre class="para">   One should be able to play Internet videos without glitches and play
   Internet games without lag.

</pre><pre class="para">   For online gaming, the desired maximum allowance for round-trip delay
   is typically 100 ms.  However, it may be less for specific types of
   games; for example, for FPS games, the maximum delay should be 50 ms.
   Transport delay is the dominant part, with a budget of 5-20 ms.

</pre><pre class="para">   For VR, a maximum delay of 1-10 ms is needed; if doing remote VR, the
   total network delay budget is 1-5 ms.

</pre><pre class="para">   Flow identification can be used for gaming and VR, i.e., it can
   recognize a critical flow and provide appropriate latency bounds.

</pre><pre class="para">   The following text was moved to this appendix because this
   information is considered a link-layer topic for which DetNet is not
   directly responsible.

</pre><pre class="para">   Digital Rights Management (DRM) is very important to the audio and
   video industries.  Whenever protected content is introduced into a
   network, there are DRM concerns that must be taken into account (see
   [Content_Protection]).  Many aspects of DRM are outside the scope of
   network technology; however, there are cases when a secure link
   supporting authentication and encryption is required by content
   owners to carry their audio or video content when it is outside their
   own secure environment (for example, see <a href="https://www.hjp.at/doc/rfc/rfc8578.html#ref_DCI" title="   [DCI]      Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC, &quot;DCI Specification,
              Version 1.3&quot;, June 2018, &lt;https://www.dcimovies.com/&gt;.

">[DCI]</a>).

</pre><pre class="para">   As an example, two such techniques are Digital Transmission Content
   Protection (DTCP) and High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection
   (HDCP).  HDCP content is not approved for retransmission within any
   other type of DRM, while DTCP content may be retransmitted under
   HDCP.  Therefore, if the source of a stream is outside of the network
   and it uses HDCP, it is only allowed to be placed on the network with
   that same type of protection (i.e., HDCP).

</pre><pre class="para">   Note: The term "link aggregation" is used here as defined by the text
   in the following paragraph, i.e., not following a more common
   network-industry definition.

</pre><pre class="para">   For transmitting streams that require more bandwidth than a single
   link in the target network can support, link aggregation is a
   technique for combining (aggregating) the bandwidth available on
   multiple physical links to create a single logical link that provides

</pre><pre class="para">   The DetNet WG decided that guidelines for establishing a
   deterministic time to establish stream startup are not within the
   scope of DetNet.  If the bounded timing for establishing or
   re-establishing streams is required in a given use case, it is up to
   the application/system to achieve it.
